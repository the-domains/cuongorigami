# Welcome to my Origami World!

Hi

I am Nguyen Hung Cuong, an Origami artist from Vietnam. I
have been creating paper designs for nearly 20 years.

I establish this blog to share my knowledge
about Origami. I hope it will be a reference resource for beginners. This blog is also my way to keep track of what I have done and archived.
